Bike Share Data analysis
---------------------
This project is done to uncover bike share usage patterns of a bike share system provider. The system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC is compared.

Getting Started
---------------
There are three main datasets and a python file namely:
1: chicago.csv
2: new_york_city.csv
3: washington.csv
These contain Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57),  End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53), Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave), End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave), User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
Gender
Birth Year
4:bikeshare_a.py: it is the python script written to provide following info:
                  #1 Popular times of travel
                  #2 Popular stations and trip
                  #3 Trip duration
                  #4 User info

Prerequisites
-------------
> pyhton installed 
> if not installed go to the link: https://www.python.org/downloads/
> Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
> text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
> terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).
> pandas can also be accessed via anaconda3.

Running the tests:
------------------
Open the folder named bikeshare.
save all the three datasets and the python file in a single folder 
open the python and open the file named bikeshare_a.py and run the python code.
note: pandas must be installed before running
